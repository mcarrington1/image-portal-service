# image-portal-service
This is the image portal service, that will include an API and database layer.

## Purpose
The image portal service exposes a RESTful API and includes functionality for a database. The database calls here are designed to function with a MongoDB database to store all data and metadata with a backing of S3 cloud storage for images. 

This is called by the Image Portal web project.
